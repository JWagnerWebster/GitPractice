Here are some notes and things!

git status
git add
git commit -m "(message)" commit
git commit -am "(message)"- add changes and commit- you do this every time
Test to make changes!
git log gives you a list of the versions (don't forget to hit q to quit)
git checkout [first five numbers of one of the hashes, not in brackets] brings out a previous version
git checout head- brings out most recent version

Once you have cloned a repo, if a change is posted, you have to "pull" it and then "commit" it to collect the changes
